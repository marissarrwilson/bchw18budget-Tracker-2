## Description
AS AN avid traveller,
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection,
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling.

The Heroku deployed application can be accessed via the following link: [https://thawing-earth-29045.herokuapp.com/](https://thawing-earth-29045.herokuapp.com/). 

## Usage
Nagivate the site via the heroku link, enter transactions offline and they will be added to tracker once back online.
